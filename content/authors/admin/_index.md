See my work on [how cultural transmission shapes the evolution of human song](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982223002439), read about [the influence of weather conditions on UK music success](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.221443), or check out [REPP](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01722-2), a Python package to run high-precision synchronisation studies over the internet, such as  tapping to the beat of music.
