I am a Lecturer in Psychology at [Goldsmiths, University of London](https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/anglada-tort-manuel-/) and co-leader of the [Music, Mind, and Brain Group](https://www.musicmindbrain.com/). My research uses computational methods and innovative behavioural experiments to study the psychological and cultural foundations of complex social behaviours, such as music and aesthetics, and their impact on society and culture.

See my work on [how cultural transmission shapes the evolution of human song](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982223002439), read about [the influence of weather conditions on UK music success](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.221443), or check out [REPP](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01722-2), a Python package to run high-precision synchronisation studies over the internet, such as  tapping to the beat of music.
